# Brown Out Detector
This project involves crafting a Brown Out Detector (BOD) circuit employing SkyWater 130nm CMOS technology. BOD circuits play a critical role in ensuring system robustness by monitoring supply voltage levels. Utilizing an asynchronous architecture, the BOD circuit operates autonomously, eliminating the need for a clock signal and thereby simplifying integration while reducing power consumption. Key design parameters include sensitivity, response time, and power efficiency. Through careful optimization, the BOD circuit enhances system reliability across various applications, guarding against potential malfunctions stemming from inadequate power supply.
